 <title>Operating &ceph; Services</title>
 <para>
  &ceph; related services are operated with the <command>systemctl</command>
  command. The operation takes place on the node you are currently logged in
  to. You need to have &rootuser; privileges to be able to operate on &ceph;
  services.
 </para>
 <para>
  The following subcommands affect all &ceph; services on a given node:
 </para>
 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>systemctl status <replaceable>target</replaceable>
   </term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Prints the status information of the service(s) specified by
     <replaceable>target</replaceable>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>systemctl start <replaceable>target</replaceable>
   </term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Starts the service(s) specified by <replaceable>target</replaceable> if
     they are not already running.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>systemctl stop <replaceable>target</replaceable>
   </term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Stops the running service(s) specified by
     <replaceable>target</replaceable>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>systemctl enable <replaceable>target</replaceable>
   </term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Enables the service(s) specified by <replaceable>target</replaceable> so
     that they are automatically started on system start-up.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>systemctl disable <replaceable>target</replaceable>
   </term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Disables the service(s) specified by <replaceable>target</replaceable> so
     that they are not automatically started on system start-up. You need to
     start them manually with <command>systemctl start</command>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
 </variablelist>
 <para>
  The following subcommand is supported for OSD related targets:
 </para>
 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>systemctl mask <replaceable>target</replaceable>
   </term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Prevents the service from being started manually or automatically.
     <command>systemctl</command> is creating a symbolic link from the specific
     target file located in <filename>/etc/systemd/system/</filename> to
     <filename>/dev/null</filename>. Targets in
     <filename>/etc/systemd</filename> override those provided by packages in
     <filename>/usr/lib/systemd</filename>. &systemd; recognizes the symbolic
     link and will not start the service.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>systemctl unmask <replaceable>target</replaceable>
   </term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Opposite to <command>systemctl mask</command>. Removes the symbolic link
     from the specific target file located in
     <filename>/etc/systemd/system/</filename> to
     <filename>/dev/null</filename>, so that targets located in
     <filename>/usr/lib/systemd</filename> are valid again.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
 </variablelist>
 <para>
  You can either operate on all &ceph; services at once, or all &ceph; services
  of a certain type (such as OSD or monitor), or a specific instance of service
  identified by its instance name.
 </para>
 <sect1>
  <title>Operating on All &ceph; Services</title>

  <para>
   To operate on all &ceph; services at once, run:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl <replaceable>subcommand</replaceable> ceph*</screen>

  <para>
   For example:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl status ceph*

  <tip>
   <para>
    <command>systemctl</command> &ceph; commands cannot operate on services not
    enabled, not masked, and those which have never been started. To include
    all present services on a node, use the <command>rcceph</command> wrapper.
    For example:
   </para>
<screen>rcceph status</screen>
  </tip>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>Operating on All &ceph; Services of a Specific Type</title>

  <para>
   It is possible to address services of a specific type only&mdash;such as
   OSDs, monitors, or &rgw;:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl <replaceable>subcommand</replaceable> ceph-<replaceable>service_type</replaceable>*</screen>

  <para>
   A few practical examples follow:
  </para>

  <para>
   Print the status of all monitor services on a node:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl status ceph-mon*</screen>

  <para>
   Start all OSD services on a node:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl start ceph-osd*</screen>

  <para>
   Stop all &rgw; services on a node:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl stop ceph-radosgw*</screen>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>Operating on a Specific &ceph; Service</title>

  <para>
   If you want to operate on a single service on a node, you need to know its
   instance name. It is available in the output of <command>systemctl status
   ceph*</command>.
  </para>

<screen>systemctl <replaceable>subcommand</replaceable> ceph-<replaceable>service_type</replaceable>@<replaceable>instance_name</replaceable>.service</screen>

  <para>
   Print the status information of the OSD service with instance name
   <literal>0</literal>:
  </para>

<screen>systemctl status ceph-osd@0.service</screen>
