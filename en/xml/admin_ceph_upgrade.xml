  <title>General Upgrade Procedure</title>

  <para>
   Before upgrading the &ceph; cluster itself, you need to add a new version of
   the &storage; product to the existing operating system, and update the
   software to the latest versions on each cluster node. You can upgrade
   daemons in your cluster while the cluster is online and in service. Certain
   types of daemons depend upon others. For example &ceph; &rgw;s depend upon
   &ceph; monitors and &ceph; OSD daemons. We recommend upgrading in this
   order:

  <tip>
   <para>
    We recommend upgrading all the daemons of a specific type&mdash;for example
    all monitor daemons or all OSD daemons&mdash;one by one to ensure that they
    are all on the same release. We also recommend that you upgrade all the
    daemons in your cluster before you try to exercise new functionality in a
    release.
   </para>
   <para>
    After all the daemons of a specific type are upgraded, check their status.
   </para>

    Ensure each monitor has rejoined the quorum after all monitors are
    upgraded:
