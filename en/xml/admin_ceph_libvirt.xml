 <title>Using &libvirt; with &ceph;</title>
 <para>
 The &libvirt; library creates a virtual machine abstraction layer between
 hypervisor interfaces and the software applications that use them. With
 &libvirt;, developers and system administrators can focus on a common management
 framework, common API, and common shell interface (i.e.,
 <command>virsh</command>) to many different hypervisors, including
 &qemu;/&kvm;, &xen;, LXC, or VirtualBox.
 </para>
 <para>
 &ceph; block devices support &qemu;/&kvm. You can use &ceph; block devices with
 software that interfaces with &libvirt;. The following stack diagram illustrates
 how &libvirt; and &qemu; use &ceph; block devices via
 <systemitem>librbd</systemitem>.
